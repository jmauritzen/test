<h3>My wife cuts my hear now.</h3>

<h3>January 2020</h3>

<p>Today The Wife cut my hair, for the second time. </p>

<p>The Wife loves to go to the hair dresser. Or is it called the salon? In any case, she loves it. It is like a mini holiday for her. She gets to chat. She gets her scalp massaged (I had not idea that was even a thing). She gets served a cappuccino. She comes home relaxed and happy. Well worth the... Well, I don’t know how much it costs. For some reason, she is never willing to tell me. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I really dislike getting my hair cut. I try to avoid it as long as possible. At its worst, I start looking like a combination of Boris Johnson and a poorly groomed golden retriever. I don’t like spending the money, that’s one thing. I don’t like having to take time out to go to the hairdresser and then wait until they are ready. I don’t find it relaxing getting my hair cut. In fact, I find it downright stressful. </p>

<p>Making small talk with the hairdresser is the worst. First, they always ask about me. I have been trained to not talk too much about myself. That is obnoxious behavior. But it feels strange to start inquiring too much into the life of this complete stranger cutting my hair. But, how are <em>you</em> doing? Do you like your job? How is your marriage going? How do you feel about Jesus?</p>

<p>In Norway I find small talk especially hard. First, I always get the same question. They inevitably ask, where are you actually from? </p>

<p>You see, I was born in Norway and Norwegian was my first language and only language. Then my family ruined my future hair-cutting experience by moving to the US, where I spent the next 26 years.</p>

<p>Norwegian is very regional. Every region, sometimes even every town, has their own dialect. So when the hairdresser hears me speak, they might first think I just come from another region. But then I make some silly grammatical mistake that no long-term Norwegian would make. I use the wrong gender form of some word, lets say. Or I use the wrong pronoun. Then they catch on. Where are you actually from? As if I have been trying to deceive them. Darn it!, you caught on. Then I have to go through the whole spiel of explaining, that no, I am not Dutch or German. I was born here, then my family moved, blah, blah, blah. </p>

<p>I end up telling my whole life story to a total stranger. All for the pleasure of paying someone an exorbitant amount to operate a clipper for about 15 minutes. </p>

<p>So no more! Now my wife would have to learn the art of the clipper. I bought a clipper with an old fashioned wire and electric plug. I have one with a battery from before. But here is the thing about a pair of clippers with a battery: They will inevitably run out of juice in the middle of the haircut, leaving you looking like a punk rocker or a self-flaggelating monk from the Middle Ages. </p>

<p>Of course, I wouldn’t just let my wife take a pair of clippers to my head without proper training. She watched a 5 minute YouTube video ahead of time. See, there, fully trained! </p>

<p>Learning how to cut hair is apparently a process of trial and error. But I have had buzz cuts before, and in the worst case scenario, I could just have one again. Plenty of men my age go with the buzz cut—though often it is because there isn’t that much hair to buzz in the first place. </p>

<p>There was a learning curve. Making it look like she hadn’t just put a bowl over my head and shaved around was a surprisingly delicate task. </p>

<p>So how was the end result? Well, too put it this way, the marine corps would probably be mighty impressed with this first-time cut. It gets the basics right of a short haircut. It’s pretty good blended and even on both sides. The Fab Five might not be so impressed, but it is unlikely they will be dropping in any case. </p>

<p>The Wife’s New Years resolution this year is to learn to how to do more practical things. So she was an eager and willing participant in all this. The economics text books talk about specialization, and rationally I should probably just pay to get a professional to get my haircut. I have a modestly well paying job, I can afford it. </p>

<p>But there is something undervalued about doing it yourself or within the family. It gives a feeling of mastery, self-sufficiency and pride of work. I don’t know if my wife is feeling all of those things after this first hair cut, but as long as she is willing, I’m more than happy to let her continue cutting my hair. As long as she doesn’t start asking me, so where are you actually from? </p>

<h3>Taking a tech Sabbath</h3>

<p>I have been reading 24/6, a book centered around the idea of taking a sabbath from tech, one day a week. The author, Tiffany Shlain, takes the idea from the Jewish tradition (she and her husband are both Jewish), which in some cases can be quite strict and inconvenient. The same is true for Shlain’s tech version of the sabbath. Absolutely no screens. They make their plans ahead of time: Print out maps, make lists, and set up appointments ahead of time. Instead of Spotify on a phone, they recommend a record player. Instead of calls on a phone, they recommend getting a old-fashioned land line. </p>

<p>I can see the attractiveness of one, absolute screen-free day a week. In some ways, absoluteness of the rule makes it easier to follow. No grey areas (though Shlain admits that they are forced to make exceptions a few weekends where they have to work). One day a week you are transmitted back to a simpler time (like my childhood), without smartphones, iPads, and always-on connectivity. </p>

<p>At the same time, I am not tempted to try it. Part of it is that I have become genuinely dependent on new technology. I don’t even know if it is possible to order a new land-line in our apartment, which was built just last year. More so, a lot of technology makes our lives genuinely better, if only we can learn how to restrict the more addictive aspects of it. </p>

<p>So my approach, which is more piecemeal and ongoing, is to try to restrict the technology that I have. I use the program <em>freedom</em> to restrict apps on my computer and phone. I have deleted most of my social media accounts, with the exception of twitter (which I restrict with Freedom). I have deleted most news apps from my phone. </p>

<p>I have also toyed with the idea of ditching my smart phone and getting an old fashioned Nokia - good for calling and texting. I would still keep my old iPhone SE, but mainly as an iPod—no SIM card, and mainly to have around the house to listen to music, podcasts and audio books (which is what I mainly use my phone for these days). </p>

<h3>Why I hate Porsche SUVs</h3>

<p>My wife knows that I can get worked up just by seeing a certain type of car. A while ago we were taking a walk, and a large Porsche SUV rolled by. <em>Ahh, I hate that car!</em> I grumbled. Of course, the car parks a little ahead of us, and my wife says, <em>oh, that is one of my colleagues</em>. I hoped I hadn’t said that too loud. </p>

<p>I have given some thought to why I dislike that car so much. I don’t much like cars in general. I especially don’t like SUVs. And with good reason, I feel. They are fuel hungry, they take up space, and their elevated stance helps them clear not only rocks and shrubs when off-roading, but also pesky pedestrians loitering on the street. </p>

<p>But for some reason, the Porsche SUV, and similar luxury SUVs have a special place in my gallbladder, or wherever it is we store irritation-related emotions. I think it is something to do with the message the car is trying to send. Driving around a Porsche SUV has all the subtlety of a guy going around telling people, <em>Hi, I’m Tom. I’m doing quite well</em>. </p>

<p>People have of course been using cars to try to tell a story about themselves since Karl Friedrich Benz created his first horseless carriage. What the Porsche SUV seems to lack is plausible deniability. Plenty of people ride around in expensive SUV’s or pickup trucks. But they can usually come up with some plausible sounding excuse. <em>I need it to get to the cabin</em>, <em>I carry supplies for work</em>, <em>It snowed here once</em>.</p>

<p>People with sports cars can also come up with some plausible excuse, unrelated to the size of their ego. Usually, it is something to do with their love of the mechanical elegance of a finely tuned rocket on wheels. Or, as the strange sports car category name suggests, the owners see themselves participating in some strange competition, requiring the athleticism of operating a sew machine. </p>

<p>But the Porsche SUV has no plausible deniability. It is pure ego. Pure showing off. From a societal point of view, it may not be any worse than a Ford og VW, but it sure feels that way from the sidewalk. </p>

<h3>Extreme Economies, by Richard Davies</h3>

<p>The premise of Extreme Economies, by the British economist and journalist Richard Davies, is that extreme societies can tear down central economic concepts to their most elemental, and in the process also give us an idea of what the future might hold for the rest of us. It delivers on its premise, and is both entertaining and engaging, as well as thought provoking. </p>

<p>Each chapter showcases a society characterised by some combination of extreme or unusual situation. How markets function or fail to function in such societies are used to illustrate some key economic insights. </p>

<p>A notorious Louisiana jail is used to show the functioning of currency. Contrasting refugee camps illustrates both the power of free markets and the difficulty of central planning. The Congo is used to show the resiliency of markets in a non-functioning state. </p>

<p>But what I liked most about this book, was that Davies manages to show the power and resiliency of markets without fetishising them. Corruption and lack of institutions greatly limits economic potential of The Congo. Free markets lead to bad, even potentially catastrophic outcomes in the Amazonian rain forrest. </p>

<p>What I appreciated most was his dive into the importance of informal relationships and social cohesion, which are too rarely dwelled upon by economists. Davis writes about the break down of the once great industrial city Glasgow. The cities economic decline was most directly caused by the loss of competitiveness of its ship-building industry. </p>

<p>But poorly thought out city planning worsened the societal breakdown. Working class Glaswegians traditionally lived in cramped, centrally located tenement housing. These may not have been ideal, but there was a strong social cohesion among the residents and high level of trust. City planners who moved residents out to larger, more modern block-apartments on the city outskirts had good intentions. But they ruined this community. People were left physically and socially isolated. </p>

<p>Of course, in different forms, cities around the world have been making this mistake. Building out and emptying out city centres in exchange for far-flung suburbs and exurbs, leaving people dependent on cars. The modern epidemics of anxiety and loneliness has a lot to do with bad city planning. </p>

<h3>Rebalanced Economics</h3>

<p>Traditional weight of economics is not wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>In western countries, abundance has made the traditional focus on efficiency, free trade, and resource allocation less important.</li>
<li>Yet the market failures that go along with consumption has not decreased. Linear. Thus This becomes a much bigger part</li>
<li>Politicians and economists still focused on minor efficiency losses of, for example, pollution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A tragedy of errors: Chernobyl.</h3>

<p>A certain subset of people will gladly tell anyone willing to listen how stupid it is to be against nuclear power. This emissions free source of electricity is plentiful. More than plentiful actually. Theoretically inexhaustible, at least at any reasonable human scale. Countries that have completely de-carbonized their electricity system, like France and Sweden, have done it largely on the back of nuclear power. Few examples (yet) exist of countries kicking carbon with renewables. More so, historically, nuclear is incredibly safe. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than coal, gas, oil, even hydropower. </p>

<p>At a logical level, all these arguments still hold after reading Chernobyl. The book appears incredibly well researched, and large parts read like a fast paced thriller. The author fair-handedly discusses the many advantages of nuclear power in a concluding chapter. But the reader cant help but to understand the deep, instinctive skepticism to nuclear power. </p>

<p>The engineers, fire fighters, and conscripts that were exposed to deadly radiation met an invisible, odorless, and silent killer. They could be exposed to a deadly dose of radiation, without realizing it. The deadly effects only took effects made themselves apparent only hours, even days or weeks later. It is like something out of a horror movie. Worse than a horror movie. </p>

<p>Chernobyl was terrible, but what was really horrifying was the real possibility that it could have been so much worse. The engineers working to contain the disaster were worried by a scenario they referred to the China Syndrome. This was the idea that the exposed nuclear core would burn through the concrete base, burrowing down to the ground water long underground, and then contaminating huge swaths of modern day Ukraine and Belarus for hundreds of years. Maybe longer. This was one of several horrifying possibilities in the immediate wake of the explosion. </p>

<p>The soviet experts who designed the Chernobyl reacted insisted, even decades after the accident, that the reactor design was safe. It was operator error and a freak, one in a million confluence of events that led to the accident. It is hard not to make comparisons to modern-day western experts confidently expressing the safety of nuclear power. This is perhaps an unfair comparison, but easy to make nonetheless. </p>

<p>I have been lukewarm on nuclear power, something this book only helped reinforce. But this has been primarily been on economic grounds. Pouring resources into nuclear, a technology that seems to get more expensive with time, seemed to be like walking against the wind in a period where wind, solar, and battery costs have been plummeting. </p>

<p>Nuclear proponents, like those of coal with hypothetical carbon storage technology, seem to be wedded to the status quo of huge power stations dispatching power through wide transmission system. The few new nuclear power stations that have been started in the western world have ended up years, sometimes decades delayed and hugely over budget. Even China seems to have problems scaling up their nuclear power build-out. Abandoning these ambitions these ambitions seems like it could lead to both a cheaper and cleaner electricity system. Citizens may get the added bonus of a little extra peace of mind as well. </p>

<h3>Best 10 books I have read this year.</h3>

<p>I see several people posting their favorite 10 books this year, so I thought I would do the same. Most of these I have also wrote longer reviews for. </p>

<ol>
<li>The existential guide by Gordon Marino.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can not get this book out of my head. Part philosophy, part memoir, Gordon Marino, a philosophy professor and former boxer, distills the essence of the existentialist school of philosophy into chapters exploring the range of human experience and emotion. Every time I get sucked into a spiral of negative thinking, whether it be about my career or family, I come back to the lessons of this book, and it puts me in a better place. Not many books can do that. </p>

<ol>
<li>Kochland by Christopher Leonard</li>
</ol>

<p>A well researched and fair history of Koch industries and the brothers who built it into its modern colossus. The book is damning in showing how money has an undue influence on politics in the US. But the redeeming sides of the company and its owner-brothers also comes through. Many, myself included, might come away surprising by how likeable the Kochs are. </p>

<ol>
<li>Adaptive Markets by Andrew Lo</li>
</ol>

<p>Economists have long stolen mathematical models from physics and chemistry as the basis for their models of markets and human interaction. This book makes the case that biology might be a more realistic source of modeling. </p>

<ol>
<li>Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport</li>
</ol>

<p>Get off social media, delete most of your apps, and gain control of your life. A solid guide to how to deal with digital overload.</p>

<ol>
<li>Educated, By Tara Westover</li>
</ol>

<p>A story about growing up with a religious extremist and abusive family, but also about succeeding against the odds. </p>

<ol>
<li>Extreme Economies, By Richard Davies</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the best economics books I have read. Davies extreme case-studies to showcase sentral issues in economics. He shows the importance of institutions by describing The Congo, and how informal social institutions can hold together a community by describing the downfall of Glasgow. What I liked best: He acknowledges the resilience of free markets without fetishising them. </p>

<ol>
<li>Superpower, By Russell Gold</li>
</ol>

<p>Wind and solar power have become cheap. This is a frustrating, but telling story about how government actions stands in the way of better making use of these new and economical energy sources. </p>

<ol>
<li>The Underground Railroad, By Colson Whitehead</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the few literary novels I have read this year. In a world where racist ideologies seem to be having a comeback, it is useful to be reminded of the horrors of slavery.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rest, By Alex Soojung-Kim Pang</li>
</ol>

<p>The American (and Korean, Japanese, British, etc) preoccupation with long hours has a flaw. History is full of examples of highly successful people who make time for rest. In fact, as Pang argues, rest is completely central to the success of many with creative professions. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why We Sleep, By Mathew Walker.</li>
</ol>

<p>As someone who has always had problems sleeping, I found this book on the ongoing science of sleep to be fascinating. As we should all know through experience, a good nights sleep is essential to being happy, successful and healthy. Also includes lots of solid tips on getting a good nights rest.</p>

<h3>Slow-math with Joseph Kadane</h3>

<p>This semester, like many in the past, I have tried to learn a little more statistics or mathematics. This semester I picked up <em>The Principles of Uncertainty</em>, by Joseph Kadane. But I tried a slightly different approach to learning this book. </p>

<p>Often times I have had as a goal to finish a book. This has meant going quickly through chapters and skipping most exercises. But with this book I decided to take it slow. Working through only a few pages per day, and trying all the exercises. The book was organized in a way conducive to this type of learning. Exercises were placed after each short subsection. I could read a little bit and then work on a handful of exercises. It was slow-going, but I definitely got a much fuller understanding for the material. </p>

<p>As for the book, it is the type of book on probability that I have long sought after. It is rigorous, with plenty of equations and math, but at the same time spends time discussing the meaning and interpretation of the probability equations. The author is a proponent of a subjective Bayesian perspective, and motivates the basic tenets of probability through the idea of making bets based on probability of beliefs. It is an intuitive and believable approach. I suspect that this perspective also encourages a focus on interpretation, rather than just the mechanical maths. Here is one more reason to be a Bayesian. </p>

<h3>What have I learned this semester</h3>

<h3>Bill Bryson’s <em>The Life and Times of the thunderbolt Kid</em></h3>

<p>I have read a handful of Bill Bryson’s books. They are usually funny, oftentimes insightful, and always enjoyable. <em>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</em> is basically a collection of stories about his childhood in 1950’s Des Moines Iowa. I listened to the audiobook version, oftentimes in bed before going to sleep. I am sure that my chuckling disturbed and annoyed my wife, who was trying to sleep. There were a few things that struck me while reading. </p>

<p>You could write it off as just nostalgia, but Bryson makes the case that things were better in the 1950’s - at least in an upper midwest mid-sized city like Des Moines. He talks about a vibrant city centre with lots of unique independent shops. It seemed like the young Bryson and his friends could roam freely around town, and this forms the basis of many of his fondest childhood memories. In the decades that would come, the city centres in the US often became hollowed out, as families moved to far-flung suburbs, and independent stores were replaced by national chains. Something was lost in this transition, which hopefully can be partially recaptured as city centres become revitalized. </p>

<p>Bryson also makes a point that by the 1960’s, most middle class families could essentially afford to buy everything they needed. Consumerism after this point consisted of buying more and bigger versions of what they already had - cars, homes, tvs, etc. The 1960’s was more than 50 years ago, and the amount of consumption has increased by huge amounts since then. If middle class people were more or less satiated already then, then it basically means a large portion of modern consumption is largely wasted. Looking around a modern US suburb filled with McMansions and multiple trucks and SUV’s parked in the garage, this doesn’t strike me as absurd. </p>

<p>Finally, there was a point towards the end of the book where Bryson tells about how his father—a sports reporter for the local newspaper—who had, at different points of time, offers to work in other cities, with bigger sports markets, and much more prestige. But each time, his father had decided that family life was good in Iowa. And besides, they wouldn’t be able to afford as nice a house in one of those bigger cities. Bryson laments that his father—somone he clearly admires as a writer—could have been one of the great sports reporters. But I found myself admiring Bryson’s father. And I wonder if those priorities—family, community and joy of work over prestige and climbing to the top—is also something more common to that time. </p>

<ul>
<li>Things were better in the 50s - city centre with independent shops.</li>
<li>Consumerism, already peaked in the 1960s.</li>
<li>Father could have been a star if he moved to a bigger market.</li>
</ul>

<h3><em>The Man Who Solved the Market</em> by Gregory Zuckerman</h3>

<p><em>The Man Who Solved the Market</em> by Gregory Zuckerman is about the billionaire mathematician and investor Jim Simons and the hedgefund, Renaissance Capital, that he founded and ran. A good biography tells a lot about the times and environment of a person, and this is very much the case for this book. This book is not just about the life of a billionaire investor, but more importantly how finance has moved from a clubby world where trades were done based on a good story and intuition to a world dominated by computers, math and algorithms. </p>

<p>There were a few things that I thought were especially interesting about the story of Simons and Renaissance. The first was that Simons was an established academic mathematician and passed forty before he started his firm. His firm didn’t really start gaining success until he was nearing 50. In a world where the 20-something entrepreneur is seen as the standard and forty is over the hill, this provided a striking counter example. In fact most new firms are started by people in their 40’s and 50’s. Life experience does, after all, count for something. </p>

<p>The second aspect I found interesting was that the firm was built up based on hiring people who lacked the traditional qualifications of working in finance. Instead of MBA’s, they hired math PhDs, computer scientists and physicists. Their particular experience or skills weren’t that important. They just wanted people that were smart, and figured they could figure out what they needed on the job.</p>

<p>This strategy was based on the idea that they just wanted really smart people. But I suspect that they benefited in another, equally important way: They got people with diverse experiences, ideas and knowledge. Had they hired only people who had PhDs in mathematical statistics (which most of their modelling was based on), they may have gotten an equal number of smart people, but I doubt they would have been as successful. They wouldn’t have had the same breadth of ideas floating around. </p>

<p>The last chapters of the book had a focus on politics. Simons became a major contributor to liberal causes and democratic candidates in his retirement. But more famously, Robert Mercer, who succeeded Simons as CEO, was a major backer of Donald Trump, and arguably did more than anyone else to help him get elected. Mercer appears to have had a long affiliation with fringe ideas, conspiracy theories and even far right-wing racial ideologies. His ideas tended to raise the eyebrows of the people he worked with, but he was generally seen as harmless until he helped elect Donald Trump. If you needed a good example of the harm that can be done when money and politics are allowed to mix too freely, you could almost not find a better example. </p>

<h3><em>More from Less</em> By Andrew McAfee: An intriguing idea, but a disappointing book</h3>

<p>Andrew McAfee’s book <em>More from Less</em> has at its heart an intriguing observation: In our modern economy we are producing more while using fewer raw materials. McAfee’s favorite prop to make this point is the smartphone, which replaces at least a half dozen gadgets: telephone, music player, camera, pager and the list goes on. He goes on to argue that this is not just a single case, citing statistics that show declining use of a whole series of raw materials. </p>

<p>I was looking forward to an in depth and well thought out analyses of this trend. But on this front the book largely disappoints. The author makes an argument about the inherent push of capitalist systems to cut costs in the face of competition, thereby reducing inputs of raw materials. Point well taken, but then instead of going further in depth, the author largely moved on to a hodgepodge of tangential issues. </p>

<p>The author discusses climate change, increasing inequality, the opioid crisis and a who’s-who list of other big modern issues. But I was often left wondering how it all related to the main argument of the book. </p>

<p>And while he seemed to veer far off course, I felt there were a lot of interesting questions and issues he could have taken a stab at. Besides pointing to the iphone, he barely discussed the role of information technology in reducing our use of raw materials. The amount of raw materials we need to create and store knowledge must be the most dramatic examples of doing more with less. There are also glaring exceptions to the trend of less raw material use. Take the trend of people driving huge SUV’s around cities. </p>

<p>And finally, I find the modern sanguine approach of modern economics to the big problems of our day as off putting. Capitalism will not solve climate change on its own, a fact that McAfee admits. But at the same time he seems to down play the the real threat that climate change poses. Perhaps that is because focusing too much time on the massive market failure that is global warming would detract from his main argument, which seems to be something like <em>capitalism sure is swell</em>. </p>

<h3>The Life and Times of Robin Williams</h3>

<p>I picked up a biography of Robin Williams recently, “Robin” by Dave Itzkof. Celebrity biographies are usually not something that I read. But I was curious about Williams. First, having come of age in the 90s and 2000s, Robin Williams was one of the most visible stars, for better or for worse. He managed to make an impression in both his typical zany, comedic roles as well as his more dramatic, somber roles. There was also the contrast and even seeming contradiction between the zany outward persona and his death by suicide. </p>

<p>Given how much our culture idolises and glamorises movie stars, I was surprised by how uninteresting I found most parts of his biography. Certainly, there were dramatic moments in his life: His first big breaks in entertainment, marital conflicts and substance abuse problems. Yet, a lot of the biography reads something like “Then he did this movie, some anecdotes from other actors, the movie was critiqued/lauded, made money/lost money, and so on.” </p>

<p>To me, the biographies of scientists and entrepreneurs that I have read have tended to provide more compelling stories. This might be because these biographies often are about the interaction of the person and the society and ideas around them. The biography of Steve Jobs is also about the computer age. A biography of Einstein will be intertwined with european interwar politics and the dawning of the nuclear age. Perhaps the biography of an entertainer could say something about the times that they live in, but I couldn’t seem to find much in this biography. </p>

<p>William’s suicide seems to still be shrouded in some mystery, 5 years after his death. The biography seems to provide a medical explanation. Based on his third wife’s account, Williams had a brain disease similar to parkinsons. This both dulled his famously quick comedic reflexes, while also slowly affecting everything from his mood to his movements. The cause of his death, it is intimated, could well better be ascribed to brain disease, and not suicide. </p>

<p>It doesn’t seem everyone close to Williams accepted this explanation. Behind the grinning mania, Williams seemed to have some depressive tendencies. He was sensitive to critiques of his films, and was crushed by the thought that he was being surpassed by a new generation of comics and actors.</p>

<p>I think there is a general lesson there. Williams had a tendency to sacrifice most other things in his life to his entertainment career. He left two failed marriages behind him (though he appeared to have maintained a loving relationship with his children). He conquered the highest career peaks of his industry, yet his singular focus also left him exposed to the inevitable descent from those peaks. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky strategy, even for hollywood stars. </p>

<h3>The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead</h3>

<p>It has been a long time since I read a real life literary novel, but I recently finished Colson Whitehead’s <em>The Underground Railroad</em>. The plot is straightforward. The protagonist is a slave in a brutal Mississippi cotton plantation. She stands out all her life as being different, odd, even crazy and potentially bewitched. Together with another slave, who had the rare ability to read, she plots an escape with the help of a sympathetic white local. </p>

<p>After an initial sprint through the swamps, she finds herself in the local branch of the Underground Railroad. In a novel mostly defined by brutal realism, the Railroad is a notable element of surrealism. It is portrayed as an actual underground railroad line with tracks and locomotives. </p>

<p>The novel follows her path from station to station, with her hopes of establishing a fresh start as a free person being continuously crushed. She is pursued by a ruthless slave hunter, who seems equally motivated by some deranged principle as by the actual payoffs from capturing the runaway slave. </p>

<p>This is a brutal novel. But in a time where white nationalism and other racial ideologies seem to be emerging around the world, it is useful to be reminded of the horrors that such ideologies can bring.</p>

<h3>Mostly plants: a few weeks as a mostly vegetarian</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago, my wife got me to watch a documentary on Netflix about the benefits of a “plant-based diet”, which appears to be what people call vegan who don’t want to be associated with that word’s hippy connotations. The focus of the documentary, which was called “Game Changers” was on the athletes who claimed that a mostly plant based diet had actually boosted their performance. But there was also some attention paid to the health benefits of going vegan. I fact-checked some of these health claims after watching the documentary. Especially the claims when it comes to heart-health seem to have quite a lot of credence. I have some heart-disease in my family. My mom has to take medication for high blood pressure and had a scare in her late 40’s. My dad also had high blood pressure and died of an aneurism in his early 6o’s. I am in good health overall, but I am also getting old enough to admit that I am in fact not invincible. </p>

<p>My wife suggested that we try a week as mostly vegetarians and I was ready to give it a go. We mainly decided to try to cut out meat, while still giving ourselves the option of eating dairy, eggs and butter. But I still wanted to cut-down on all those things. I am lactose intolerant, so switching from milk products to soya- and oat-based substitutes isn‘t a drastic change. </p>

<p>We also agreed that we would make exceptions for things like visiting friends and family. We don’t want to be THOSE vegetarians. Last weekend I took my son and visited my family that lives in Stavanger. I in large part took a break from vegetarianism during this visit. </p>

<p>I should also say that our son in large part is already a vegetarian by his own volition. He likes pasta and vegetables and fruits, but has rarely wanted to eat meat. His diet has not really changed. </p>

<p>The verdict after a couple of weeks has been largely positive. To the great credit of my wife, who has taken it upon herself to find recipes, the dinner food we have had has been really good. This is something I have noticed before. When you impose the restriction of no meat, you are sometimes forced to put a bit more effort in getting flavorful and varied food. The default meat and potatoes is not available. </p>

<p>I have not really missed eating meat. It was my time to do the grocery shopping this week, and it struck me how much of the grocery shelves were filled with meat and animal products. But it was a pure joy loading up on colorful vegetables and various beans, nuts, seeds and pastas. The great variation of plant foods comes into contrast when you look away from the bland pinks and reds of meat. </p>

<p>Another benefit that both me and my wife have noticed is that our grocery bills have come down a bit. Initially I thought the extra costs of more fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts as well as substitute soya-yogurt and the like would outweigh the cost of meat. But even after loading up on these things, our weekly grocery bill seems to have gone down somewhat. Not dramatically, but noticeably. </p>

<p>We will continue our experiment. The disadvantages and costs seem to be modest, especially when we maintain a practical and flexible perspective. The advantages, on the other hand seem to be great. We have been eating varied, tasty and enjoyable meals while actually spending less money. Research seems to suggest a host of health effects, with little potential downside as long as you maintain a good mix of vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts, with a
multiple vitamin thrown in for good measure. </p>

<p>And then there are the other benefits. Cutting down on meat is an important way of reducing climate emissions and other pollution. Many modern animal farming practices seem both unsustainable and unethical. Images of chickens crowded together in filthy cages and injected regularly with both hormones and antibiotics is enough for many to go vegetarian. </p>

<h3>What's wrong with Economics? Too much smart.</h3>

<p>Academic economics has a well known cultural problem. The profession is heavily tilted towards white, male and straight. Recent studies have pointed to a sometimes nasty environment for women and minorities at conferences and at many departments. Popular message-board like websites catering to economists are well known cesspools of incivility. </p>

<p>In some ways, this is puzzling. As far as I can see, there is nothing inherent in the field of economics that invites this nastiness. In the departments I have known that have a hard time attaining and retaining female and minority candidates, I usually have not gotten the sense of any outright sexism or racism (though, it is possible that there is plenty that I don’t see). Individually, most of the departmental members seem good intentioned and likeable. </p>

<p>But I have a theory of how a more subtle, seemingly benign cultural trait can foster a lot of unnecessary nastiness: An over-emphasis on being <em>smart</em>. </p>

<p>I was having a conversation with a couple of friends of mine not too long ago. Both are economists, and to be clear, in addition to being exceptionally talented researchers, they are kind, warm and open. And, both are female. </p>

<p>But there was something that caught my attention in our conversation. I had just presented a paper. And I was grousing a bit about what I had felt had been overly aggressive questioning and commenting by one of the seminar participants. Aggressive questioning is also a well known trait in economics departments. </p>

<p>One of my friends agreed that the questioning had been overly aggressive. But, she assured me, the guy was really smart. </p>

<p>A bit later I was again gossiping a bit, explaining how I found one of my economist-colleagues a bit haughty. “But he’s smart, right?”, my friend asked. </p>

<p>I didn’t think much about these comments then and there. But later it struck me how strange they were. A persons perceived smartness seemed to outweigh other negative traits. Being smart gave you a pass on anti-social behavior. </p>

<p>This reminds me of some studies of businesses with <em>star</em> cultures. An investment bank, for example, where certain traders gain star status by making big bucks for the firm. The finding of this research is that firms and organisations with such cultures have a tendency to develop toxic environments. They become competitive, as people strive to obtain star-status. Those that do obtain star-status are given wide latitude to mistreat others and ignore social norms.</p>

<p>Economics departments foster such a star system. Partially, it is through an over-emphasis on publications in a few elite journals. But also through evaluation based on a narrow and poorly defined trait: “smartness”. </p>

<p>When economists say that someone is smart, I get the sense that they have not thought particularly hard about what exactly that means. I get the sense that many define it as the trait of being mentally quick. Able to, for example, quickly solve a math problem. Or, able to, on-the-fly, find some flaws in research being presented at a seminar. </p>

<p>From the moment someone takes the first step of the academic economist career ladder, they are faced with this bias towards smartness. American style graduate programs bombard students with technically demanding mathematical economics, especially in the first year. If you can succeed with this, you can succeed as an economics researcher, the thinking goes.</p>

<p>At the US graduate program that I started (but left after having completed the requirements for a masters degree), the point of the grueling first year was quite explicit. The program accepted an incoming class that was 2 to 3 times as large as that they had the resources to support through a PhD. The weak would be weeded out, and the strong survive. </p>

<p>Perhaps this emphasis on smartness, as defined by quickness of thought or a natural technical proficiency could be defended if it were a dominant success factor in doing economics research. But I’m far from convinced that is the case. </p>

<p>Certainly, some ability to tackle a bit of math and a few technicalities is important to the modern economics field. But my impression is that the narrow definition of <em>smart</em> as quick, is far from the most important trait in being a successful economics researcher. </p>

<p>I am not particularly quick. I am slow with math. And I am definitely not the one catching flaws in people’s seminar and conference presentations. But these things don’t seem to impede me writing research papers. Here I feel there are a mix of traits and skills that are equally if not more important than pure smarts. Curiosity, doggedness, creativity and the ability to make connections between ideas are all things that I think have been more important for me in writing decent research articles. </p>

<p>I am no research superstar. But I suspect that even those that are would readily admit that the skill set required is much more than just smarts. </p>

<p>The downsides to selecting and evaluating economists on this narrow traits are then many. In addition to contributing to a potentially toxic professional environment, the profession risks missing out on lots of diverse talent, whose strength as researchers lies outside <em>smartness</em>. It is striking that in studies of what demographics are usually described as being <em>smart</em>, it tends to be heavily biased towards white and male. My sense is that a lack of outward diversity is often also a sign of a lack of intellectual and creative diversity. </p>
